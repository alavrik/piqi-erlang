Piqi-erlang 0.7.0 (October 28, 2013)
====================================

The main change of this release is the rewrite of the "piqic-erlang" code
generator in Erlang. It still relies on the "piqi compile" front-end written in
OCaml, but the Erlang code generation and support for various Erlang-specific
features is now fully implemented in Erlang. As a result:

- we were able to move the piqi-erlang code from the main Piqi project
  repository into its own repo
- drop dependency on "piqi_src" and OCaml code
- "piqi-erlang" has a new optional dependency called piqi-binary that includes
  precompiled "piqi" executable for various platforms
- "piqic-erlang-ext" and therefore *_piqi_ext.erl go away; "piqic-erlang" now
  generates serializers and deserializers for multi-format converters (i.e.
  gen_X*/2, /3 and parse_X*/2, /3 functions) directly in *_piqi.erl

This was a major effort and it wouldn't have been possible without support of
many Piqi-erlang users. Thank you everyone for your bug reports, suggestions and
patience.

Special thanks goes to Dennis Docter who troubleshooted the Erlang name
normalization problem in the new implementation and contributed the solution and
the tests.

Other changes:

  - "--gen-defaults" compiler option is deprecated. "piqic-erlang" now generates
    _piqi:default_X/1 without asking
  - generate default values for Erlang record fields if they are defined in the
    original Piqi spec
  - add a new "erlang-default" alias property; when specified, it overrides the
    Piqi-default value for the type in the generated "*_piqi:default_<type>/0"
    functions

Miscellaneous:

  - piqi-erlang documentation is now distributed with the source code
    (doc/piqi-erlang.md)
  - continuous builds via Travis-CI
  - support for building piqi-erlang as a rebar dependency on FreeBSD
